Most of the code I write is for government contracts so very little makes it into the wild.  I wrote this code for a 'lunch-n-learn' at Praeses. I am proud of it because although it is relatively small, it demonstrates several Javascript strategies including private global variables and the module pattern using immediate functions. Some of it was borrowed from various places, some css from Ryan Bates nifty-generators and the some from the jQuery plugin guides.

This was a simple demonstration for employees new to Javascript and jQuery.  This Plugin could use html5 `data` attributes to store state and remove elements in a much more sophisticated way.

# jquery.notice

This plugin was written for demonstration purposes.  Use at your own demise, muhahahahahaha!!!

use:

    $(element).notice(method, type, message);

methods

    display
    remove

types

    note
    success
    notice
    error
    warning
